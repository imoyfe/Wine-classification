# Wine classification

#### In this project we compare the performance of 3 different models for a multilabel classification problem:
* Decison Tree
* Random Forest
* Support Vector Classification

#### Decision Tree visualization:

After checking the metrics for each model, we wanted to find out the feature importance that algorithm that performs the best is taking into consideration:
